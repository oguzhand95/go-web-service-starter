# go-web-service-starter

This project is basis for my golang based web services. It is not the best and there are certainly some improvements 
needs to be made.

Only 3 pages exists: Home, Login and Register.

Login and Register pages has required components, however Home page only has some placeholder text. Please see how it looks on `Screenshots` section.

## Usage

Build and run `src/cmd/main.go`

You may need to set database environment parameters for postgresql. Please see for environment parameters:
